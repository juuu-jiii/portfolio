                <i>floG</i> (short for <i>For The Love of Golf</i>) is a networked multiplayer simultaneous golf
                game where players can derail opponents using interactive obstacles and hazards that are moved or
                activated using triggers distributed over the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary aim of this project was to learn about and apply networking concepts to a game made in
                Unreal, whilst still creating a fun and novel player experience.

                        Some interactive hazards like the one above use particle systems to communicate their
                        activation. These "cosmetic" gameplay events are executed on all devices to keep their world

                <h3>Polishing Multiplayer Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    Implementing a lobby will make the matchmaking system more robust, since players can currently join
                    an in-progress game at any time. Also, displaying a loading screen when waiting for players to
                    finish joining levels will create a smoother user experience.
                </p>
                <h3>Preventing Degenerate Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    Time could be factored into the scoring system. Currently, a player can simply wait at the start
                    line for their opponents to sabotage each other, before making their way to the hole after everyone
                    else has done so without worrying about interactive objects and hazards affecting their score.
                </p>
                <h3>Better Signalling Interactive Obstacles and Hazards</h3>
                <p>
                    Adding details conveying the "danger zones" of MapMovers might make them less frustrating for
                    players to navigate, and overall help ensure maps are not harder than intended to traverse.
