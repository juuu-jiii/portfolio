                A mashup of the action puzzle shooters Luxor, Bust-a-Move, and Breakout. Players must make trick shots
                using pinpoint timing and accuracy to clear marbles bouncing around an arena by shooting projectiles of
                matching colours at them.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Designed a system that ensures players are only given projectiles whose colours match marbles
                        and
                        other projectiles in the arena to prevent levels from dragging on unfairly if players are not
                        given
                        colours they need.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Added targets to further centre gameplay around precision, by rewarding the player with
                        bonus points for making trick shots and hitting optional targets in harder-to-reach areas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a system that slows marbles down as the arena fills up to prevent players from feeling
                        overwhelmed and keep them focused on clearing marbles. As the arena empties, marbles start
                        speeding up again to maintain a balance of difficulty.

                        Leveraged a dictionary to track quantities of marbles and projectiles in the arena, so that the
                        player is only given projectiles whose colours match marbles and other projectiles in the arena.

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            The count gets updated each time a marble or projectile is instantiated or destroyed.

                            When all instances of a colour have been cleared, the corresponding entry is removed from

                        Used coroutines to define time-based gameplay events, like iframe animation sequences when the

                <h3>
                    Encouraging Trick Shots
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <i>mrbl.</i> is about precision and making trick shots. Besides targets, however, the
                    player has little reason to play aggressively. To incentivise this, longer-range
                    shots could be rewarded with more points.
                </p>
                <h3>Designing for Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    <i>mrbl.</i>'s mechanics revolve around the use of colour, so accessible design is important.
                    Symbols could be used to denote colours in-game. Alternatively, the colour scheme could be made
                    configurable.
                </p>
                <h3>Pickups</h3>
                <p>
                    Power-ups that fall from the top of the screen can add variety to the game. Power-downs could also
                    be
                    dropped occasionally to keep gameplay interesting, by giving the player something else to avoid.
