            <p>
                <i>Project Ping</i> is an in-progress plug-and-play networked multiplayer asset that uses Steam for
                matchmaking. It started as a project for an Independent Study class in Tools Development, and I have
                since continued to expand on it. As this is my formal introduction to networking in Unreal, I
                documented my processes with the hopes of them someday coming in handy to anyone going down the same
                rabbit holes I did.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end goal is to create a well-documented general-purpose multiplayer asset that any gameplay
                logic can be applied on top of, and to learn the ins and outs of the Unreal networking framework
                along the way.
            </p>

                <b>Role: </b>Sole Developer<br>
                <b>Timeframe: </b>10 weeks (currently in progress)<br>

            <h2>Prioritising Flexibility and Scalability</h2>
            <p>
                As one of the goals of this project was to create a general-purpose networked multiplayer asset, I
                developed with flexibility in mind, and added minimal gameplay logic to test the systems I was
                developing. That way, any bugs I ran into would most likely be coming from netcode and not gameplay
                code. Furthermore, this meant the asset would also allow logic for many kinds of games to be slapped
                on top of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I gained experience creating and documenting a codebase for scalability, since this project would need
                to support longer-term development (not just for a semester). I also learned lots about the main
                classes in Unreal's gameplay framework, like the Game Instance and Player State.
            </p>
            <h2>Looking Under the Hood</h2>
            <p>

            </p>

            - to keep project in scope, need to make baby versions of functionality of systems that are commonly
            found in multiplayer games. Like the session browser.

            Ben's multimouse page is a fabulous example you can pull from.
            <h2>Flocking Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Flocking rules are mathematical functions describing movement of an AI agent in
                relation to others around it. Combining several flocking rules results in emergent behaviour when
                multiple agents are placed near each other. I used eight flocking rules in this project:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cohesion: steers each agent towards the average position of its neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: adjusts each agent's velocity to match the average velocity of its neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separation: makes agents stay some minimum distance apart to avoid collisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lifespan: determines the duration of the current simulation run.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tendency Toward User Interaction Location: "attracts" agents to the cursor position when the
                    left mouse button is held.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Environment Retention: keeps agents within the screen's bounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obstacle Avoidance: makes agents avoid user-placed obstacles in the environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Max Speed: prevents agents from travelling at arbitrarily fast speeds.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The influence of these rules, alongside agents' visual range and view distance, are all adjustable using
                sliders.
            </p>
            <h2>How do they Move?</h2>
            <p>
                The influence of each flocking rule is a numerical value corresponding to the weight
                of each rule in physics calculations. Physics are calculated for each agent, rule-by-rule,
                to obtain a net force vector used to update each agent's on-screen movement for that frame.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this approach (and ignoring gravity and collisions), I avoided
                Unity's physics and rigid body system altogether, improving performance.
            </p>
            <h2>Interactivity</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from user-defined obstacle placement and making agents flock to the user's cursor while the left
                mouse button is held down, several interactive and customisable elements are featured to facilitate
                creation of generative art:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the influence of variables and rules can be adjusted using sliders;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the colour of agent trails can be customised;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the theme/colour palette of the simulation can be switched; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    the visibility of placed obstacles can be toggled on/off
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                Results are mixed. Based on supplied parameters, various types of flocking behaviours can be observed,
                but it can sometimes be hard to see the individual effects of each flocking rule, especially when there
                are more than 4-5 simultaneously affecting an agent's velocity.
            </p>
            <p>
                This could be because of the finicky nature of the flocking rules themselves.
                Some rules have a more noticeable effect on resultant behaviour, and so certain rules can
                overpower others. Fine-tuning the ranges of weights each rule can be adjusted to on the front end
                alongside allowing 4-5 flocking rules to be applied at any one time maximum might help make the effects
                of individual rules more pronounced.
            </p>
