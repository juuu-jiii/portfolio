                An interactive version of Craig Reynolds's boids simulation containing 90 agents, with
                modifications and additions made to the original framework to facilitate the interactive creation of
                generative art.

            <h2>Flocking Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Flocking rules are mathematical functions that describe the movement behaviours of a single AI agent in
                response to others around it. Combinations of multiple flocking rules governing an agent's movement can
                result in emergent behaviour when several agents are placed in close proximity to each other. For this
                project, I included a total of eight flocking rules:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cohesion: steers each agent towards the average position of its neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: adjusts each agent's velocity to match the average velocity of its neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separation: makes agents stay some minimum distance apart to avoid collisions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lifespan: determines the duration of the current simulation run.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tendency Toward User Interaction Location: "attracts" agents to the cursor position when the
                    left mouse button is held.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Environment Retention: keeps agents within the screen's bounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obstacle Avoidance: makes agents avoid user-placed obstacles in the environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Max Speed: prevents agents from travelling at arbitrarily fast speeds.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These influence of the above rules is adjustable using sliders in the application. On top of these
                rules,
                agents' visual range and distance they can see ahead of themselves in a straight line can also be
                adjusted.
            </p>
            <h2>How do they Move?</h2>
            <p>
                The influence of each of the flocking rules above is a numerical value that determines the weight
                of each rule in physics calculations. Each agent keeps track of its own velocity vector, and physics
                calculations are performed for each agent by manipulating said velocity vectors individually. The
                positions of each agent are then set on-screen manually after each frame.
                I ignored physical properties and behaviours like gravity and collisions in this project because I did
                not find them relevant. As a result, this meant that I was able to disregard Unity's physics library and
                rigid body system in favour of the mathematical approach described above which led to improved
                performance.
            </p>
            <h2>Interactivity</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from user-defined obstacle placement and making agents flock to the user's cursor while the left
                mouse button is held down, several interactive and customisable elements are featured:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the influence of variables and rules can be adjusted using sliders;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the colour of agent trails can be customised;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the theme/colour palette of the simulation can be switched; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    the visibility of placed obstacles can be toggled on/off
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                Results are quite mixed. The system conveys various types of flocking behaviours based on supplied
                parameters, but it can be rather difficult to see the individual effects of each flocking rule at
                times, especially when there are many flocking rules (more than 4 or 5) working together to affect an
                agent's velocity at the same time. A possible reason for this is mathematical inaccuracies
                that might have been accounted for had Unity's physics library and rigid body system been used. Another
                potentially related explanation for this is the finicky nature of the flocking rules themselves.
                Some flocking rules have a greater effect on resultant behaviour than others, and so some rules can
                overpower others. A solution for this would be to fine-tune the weights of each rule under the hood
                and limit the number of rules that can be applied at any one time to 4 or 5 at most to make the effects
                of individual rules more pronounced.
