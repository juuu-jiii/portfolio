                An interactive version of Craig Reynolds's boids simulation, with
                modifications and additions made to the original framework to
                facilitate the creation of generative art.

            <h2>Flocking Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Flocking rules are mathematical functions that describe the movement behaviours of a single AI agent in
                response to others around it. Combinations of multiple flocking rules governing an agent's movement can
                result in emergent behaviour when several agents are placed in close proximity to each other. For this
                project, I included a total of eight flocking rules:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cohesion: prevents agents from breaking off from the flock, by steering each agent towards the
                    average position of its neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alignment: forces agents to move in the same general direction, by adjusting each agent's velocity
                    such that it matches the average velocity of its neighbours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Separation: states that agents should stay some minimum distance apart to avoid collisions, despite
                    the previous two rules bringing them together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lifespan: determines how long an agent is alive for, and therefore the duration of the current
                    simulation run altogether.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tendency Toward User Interaction Location: Agents are “attracted” to the location of the cursor
                    while the user holds down the left mouse button.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Environment Retention: Keeps agents within the screen's bounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Obstacle Avoidance: prevents agents from flying through obstacles placed by the user within the
                    environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speed Limitation: prevents agents from travelling at arbitrarily fast speeds.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>How do they Move?</h2>
            <p>
                The influence of each of the eight flocking rules above is a numerical value that determines the weight
                of each rule in physics calculations. These calculations are performed for each agent by manipulating
                their velocities, then setting their positions on-screen manually after each frame.
                I ignored physical properties and behaviours like gravity and collisions in this project because I did
                not find them relevant. As a result, this meant that I was able to disregard Unity's physics library and
                rigid body system in favour of the mathematical approach described above which led to improved
                performance.

            <h2>Interactivity</h2>
            <p>
                Aside from user-defined obstacle placement and making agents flock to the user's cursor while the left
                mouse button is held down, several interactive and customisable elements are featured:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    the influence of variables and rules can be adjusted using sliders;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the colour of agent trails can be customised;
                </li>
                <li>
                    the theme/colour palette of the simulation can be switched; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    the visibility of placed obstacles can be toggled on/off
                </li>
            </ul>
