I have experience in C#, C++, C, Javascript, Unity, and Visual Studio but am very interested in learning various other languages, tools, and programs. I like to focus on the programming and technical aspects of projects but I am also well versed with level design and web design. I enjoy working with a team full of talented people and creating products that are fun, interesting, and useful. And with every project I work on, I learn something new that makes the whole experience worthwhile.
                
                Hello! My name’s Emily (she/her) and you’ve reached my portfolio!
I’m a nerd for game design and a nerd for coding, which is part of why my tagline references "passion and pragmatism". When I create, I weave my way through the lofty realms of design ideas and the harsh reality of getting a computer to do what you want it to.
I'll be graduating from RIT this May with an MS in Game Design and Development and I am seeking work as a designer, as a programmer, or as a little bit of both! Feel free to reach out to me with any and all inquiries! -->

                Nice having you here!<br><br>
                I'm Choi, a geeky game designer who's equally as geeky about programming.
                <!-- I enjoy crafting solutions to design problems as much as I do tackling technical complexities. -->
                When I'm not creating or tweaking systems and levels to facilitate player satisfaction, I can be found
                wondering what instructions I need to feed my computer next to make it behave. I love working on diverse
                teams where growth and inclusion are paramount. There's always something to learn from each experience
                that I can apply to future projects. I have proficiency in C# and C/C++, with some knowledge of
                JavaScript and Python. I am also familiar with both Unity and Unreal Engine.

                                This prototype seeks to answer the question: what would happen if Luxor, Puzzle Bobble,
                                and Brick Breaker met, shook hands, and immediately decided to join forces?
                                Drawing inspiration from each of these titles and remixing their distinctive
                                mechanics, I hope to create a familiar - yet wholly fresh - medley of an
                                experience.
                            </p>

                                I used this project to familiarise myself with Unity's intricacies, and have
                                learned a ton about its built-in physics engine and life cycle hooks. I also
                                picked up ways to work around some quirks Unity has when implementing certain
                                design patterns.

                                One change I am planning to make in the future is to optimise by using object
                                pooling; since marbles get spawned and despawned frequently, this will
                                alleviate memory allocation costs during levels. I also plan to design for
                                accessibility, since much of the game's mechanics revolve around colour. Using
                                symbols together with colours might be an avenue worth exploring.

                                My first personal passion project! This was a simple top-down endliess
                                runner. Initially, I had no idea what procedural generation was, and
                                with some investigation and planning, came up with a simple
                                algorithm to dynamically generate terrain every session:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    To form a pathway, horizontal walls spawn in pairs consecutively
                                    “Flappy Bird” style, scrolling downward;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Wall spawning is controlled using random number generation, with a
                                    chance of 8 different predefined structured terrain sections occurring
                                    intermittently to keep gameplay interesting;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Walls get removed from the underlying List once out of bounds, freeing
                                    memory to be garbage-collected.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The predefined structured terrain sections include zigzags, obstacles in
                                the middle of the pathway, and even a giant roundabout!

                                This was an individual project completed as part of coursework for a web design class
                                at RIT. It is a simple 2D avoid-and-collect game where the player must control an
                                onscreen sprite using their mouse to collect all orbs within a level in order to
                                advance. However, circles must be avoided at all costs!<br /><br />
                                This was my first game/interactive experience created using JavaScipt.
                                The idea was to make an experience that was immersive yet extremely simple to pick
                                up and play. The webpage was thus designed to amplify the immersion.<br /><br />
                                The game does come with sound effects. Either turn the volume up or down, or mute
                                the browser tab entirely - your preference!

                                GET OUT (OF THY STOCKS) was a submission for the RIT Game Dev Club's Summer Game Jam
                                2021, which lasted for 48 hours. The theme was "out of stock". I was part of a team
                                of 2 - we both wanted to explore the theme's boundaries, and quite literally went
                                back in time with our entry.<br /><br />
                                The aim of the game is to defend the main character from guards as they make their
                                escape from the medieval stocks. We used checkpoint-based pathfinding to
                                move characters around. Players fend guards off by interacting with
                                environment objects.<br /><br />
                                I took on multiple roles due to team size. I created UI and menu artwork, added
                                drag/drop/throw functionality as part of ways players interact with objects, and
                                wrote the story on prologue and epilogue screens. I also supplied core gameplay
                                mechanics. Our submission ended up winning Best Overall out of 9 entries.
