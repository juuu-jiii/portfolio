                <i>Quack Attack</i> is a 2D platformer where resource management and
                pinpoint accuracy are your keys to success.
                Play as a rogue rubber ducky on a mission to
                make Rubber Ducky Day an official holiday. Jump and dash through government
                buildings and use your trusty water gun to shoot sentient office supplies
                getting between you and the president's desk!

                This game was partway through development when I joined
                the team. My goals with this project were to create a more accessible
                onboarding experience through a set of five tutorial levels, as well as
                to extend and polish existing systems and mechanics.
            </p>

                        Designed and scripted the camera to dynamically adjust its position and zoom level so players

                <p>
                    Locking cosmetic items in the wardrobe screen behind progression walls is one way to make
                    progression meaningful and encourage players to keep going. Some cosmetic items could also be
                    hidden away within secret or hard-to-reach locations in levels to reward exploration.
                </p>
                <h3>Further Polishing Camera Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    The current camera system gives players better spatial perception, but it can still
                    cause motion sickness in some people. Making the camera's panning smoother, or zooming out further
                    to reduce the amount of panning required overall may fix this problem.
                </p>
                <h3>Addressing Difficulty Spikes in Tutorials</h3>
                <p>
                    Some levels in the set of five tutorial levels were perceived to be more difficult than others
                    during the most recent round of playtesting. Simplifying the layouts of these levels based on
                    feedback will smooth out the learning curve, alongside conducting more playtesting as needed.
