                <i>Vibrant Actions</i> is an educational first-person collect-a-thon about cleaning a trash-laden
                coastline, aimed at 6th graders in the US.
                Players are shown effects of environmental pollution and can reverse
                damage done via sustainable waste management practices, with the goal of encouraging them to model these
                good practices in their daily lives.

                    <li>
                        Researched sustainable waste management practices, their relevance in early middle school
                        curricula, and how a designer might approach conveying the topic to a younger audience through
                        interactivity and play.

                    <li>
                        Used the procedural rhetoric to guide core gameplay loop design.

                    <li>
                        Designed a minigame where the player recycles trash by disposing it in the correct bin.

                    <li>
                        Created a feedback-driven experience by leveraging sound effects and animations.

                        <li>
                            Added juice by animating trash flying to the player in an arc when collected,

                            Developed an inventory system to be used alongside the recycling minigame by using a stack
                            to create the impression that the player is pulling trash out of their bag, one at a time,
                            to be disposed of.

                <p>
                    Having coastal and marine life appear gradually as the player cleans the beach up will make the
                    environment feel livelier. It will also positively reinforce the player's actions in-game, by giving
                    them a visual representation of their progress.
                </p>
                <h3>Obtaining More Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Holding more playtests with people from our target audience will help us better understand how we
                    can further enhance and tweak the experience to be as educational and engaging as possible.
                </p>
                <h3>Smoother Camera Movements when Switching States</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, the camera jumps between positions when the player changes state between collecting and
                    recycling trash. Lerping its movement between these two positions will make the transition less
                    jarring and provide a smoother experience overall.
