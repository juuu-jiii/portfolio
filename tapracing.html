                <i>TapRacing</i> is an isometric reinvention of the traditional, 3D, steering-based racer. Vehicles
                can turn 90 degrees instantaneously in either direction and strafe sideways, and the chase camera
                is locked to the same orientation throughout!
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to expose myself to the different tools at my disposal within Unreal. Everything in this
                project (except the car model) was implemented from scratch, using tools within the editor.

                    <li>
                        Designed a snappy handling model where vehicles turn instantaneously at the push of a button so
                        players can take corners quickly as needed, making success reflex-reliant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created a checkpoint system to track player lap progress, prevent cheating behaviours like
                        corner cutting, and serve as locations at which to reset the player if they crash.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Placed checkpoints primarily right before turns, since crashes typically take place when
                        cornering.

                            Instead of applying steering forces, a forward force is used to make vehicles travel in the
                            direction they are facing, and they instanatenously get rotated or moved laterally at the
                            push of a button.

                        <li>
                            Developed a finite state machine with states to define vehicle movement and collision

                <h3>AI Cars</h3>
                <p>
                    Giving players something to race against besides the clock will add a new dimension to gameplay.
                    Placing "feelers" on the front and sides of AI vehicles will give agents spatial awareness, and
                    allow
                    them to anticipate (and react appropriately to) upcoming corners.
                </p>
                <h3>More Game Modes</h3>
                <p>
                    Additional game modes beyond the currently available time attack mode will provide more ways to
                    play.
                    One such example is a "survival" mode, where vehicles speed up after each complete lap, and players
                    must
                    last as long as possible without crashing.
                </p>
                <h3>An Updated Handling Model</h3>
                <p>
                    Making vehicles slow down slightly when cornering and strafing will add a layer of complexity to
                    gameplay, as defending positions will then cost players time.
