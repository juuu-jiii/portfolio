            <h2>Concept and Design Goals</h2>
            <p>
                <i>TapRacing</i> is an isometric reinvention of the traditional, 3D, steering-based racer. Vehicles
                turn 90 degrees instantaneously in either direction and strafe sideways. The chase camera
                is locked to the same orientation throughout, so being able to differentiate right from left is
                important at all times! Gameplay focuses on fast-paced moments filled with manoeuvring obstacles and
                tackling technical sections of track, whilst racing against the clock to complete laps as quickly as
                possible.
                <!-- minimal controls, simple
                physics, keen judgment, and sharp reflexes. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                When on the track, players will also need to avoid collisions. Grinding against a barrier will slow
                vehicles down, while driving straight into a wall will result in a crash and the vehicle being
                reset. Both of these cost players valuable time, so keen judgment and sharp reflexes are key.
            </p>

            <p>
                I wanted to expose myself to the different tools at my disposal within Unreal. Everything in this
                project (except the car model) was implemented from scratch, using tools within the editor.
                <!-- Everything in this project was built from scratch within the Unreal Editor, save for the car model due
                to time constraints. I wanted to use this project to challenge myself to learn as much about the
                different tools I had at my disposal from within the engine. -->
                <!-- It involved a fair bit of exploration,
                tinkering around the engine, and looking resources up online, but I think I was quite successful in
                accomplishing the goals I set out to achieve. I have managed to familiarise myself with the interfaces
                for the editors for materials, UI widgets, and visual effects (Niagara).  -->
                <!-- I have also gotten a decent
                understanding of Unreal's blueprint system. Besides that, I've become pretty comfortable with traversing
                Unreal's forums and online documentation, having spent a fair amount of time perusing those in
                conjunction with video tutorials. -->

                <!-- I used this project to get more deeply acquainted with Unity's intricacies. Because bouncy physics are
                a cornerstone to <i>mrbl.</i>, I had to tinker around with its built-in physics engine until the way the
                marbles and projectiles behaved felt just right. I also learned about how to implement certain design
                patterns in Unity. This included creating a singleton GameManager class that could persist between
                scenes during runtime, and modifying a MonoBehaviour to behave like a generic C# class. I also learned
                about the different lifecycle hooks Unity affords, and how to leverage them to ensure that classes and
                GameObjects are populated with all the data they need each time a new scene gets loaded. -->

            <h2>Snappy Controls and Handling Model</h2>
            <p>
                Fast-paced gameplay is a core design pillar of the game, so this gave rise to the simple, snappy, and
                "instantaneous" handling model. Instead of applying steering forces, vehicles travel in the direction
                they are facing and are rotated or moved laterally at the push of a button. Players can thus take
                corners quickly as needed, making success reflex-reliant.
                <!-- Gameplay is fast-paced, so it was important that controls were designed to be simple and
                snappy, resulting in the simple handling model and "instantaneous" control system. Players can thus take
                corners quickly as needed, making their success in-game reflex-reliant. To this end, instead of applying
                steering forces, vehicles travel in the direction they are facing and are rotated at the push of a
                button. -->


                <!-- to the current system where players can steer instantaneously 90 degrees in either direction, to ensure
                they can take corners quickly as needed, with the only thing limiting their ability to do so being their
                reflexes.
                
                At the heart of <i>TapRacing</i> is its snappy and responsive control system. If tracks are to be
                constructed such that their geometry features sets of consecutive corners and tight turns, then players
                need to be equipped with the means to navigate such perils. It was thus important that vehicles in the
                game be able to turn at the push of a button, because of the intended fast-paced, reflex-reliant player
                experience. To this end, instead of applying steering forces, vehicles simply travel in the direction
                they are facing and are rotated instantaneously as required. -->

            <p>
                Because of the game's simple physics, it made sense to describe player movement using a simple FSM with
                four distinct states: Stopped, Moving, Grinding, and Crashed. 
            </p> -->
            <h2>Checkpoint System</h2>
            <p>
                Checkpoints are a series of triggers along the track. A CheckpointManager blueprint references each of
                these in an array. It ensures players traverse the track properly and visit each checkpoint in the
                specified order.
                <!-- Once all checkpoints are visited in sequence, the lap is complete.  -->
                This discourages cheating behaviours like corner cutting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Players get reset to the location of the last checkpoint visited if they crash their vehicle.
                Checkpoints were primarily placed right before corners, since crashes typically take place when
                cornering.
                <!-- Crashes usually take place when cornering, and so additional
                checkpoints have been placed right before each turn. -->

                <!-- Checkpoints have been implemented as a series of triggers spread out along the track. A
                CheckpointManager blueprint holds references to each of these in an array. It ensures the player
                traverses the track properly by checking that they visit each checkpoint in the specified order.
                When all checkpoints have been visited by the player in sequence, a lap is complete. This discourages
                cheating behaviours like corner cutting. Players also get reset to the location of the last checkpoint
                visited if they crash their vehicle. Crashes usually take place when cornering, and so additional
                checkpoints have been placed right before each turn. -->


                <!-- The checkpoint system also helps determine where to reset
                the player if they crash their vehicle. Players get reset to the location of the last checkpoint Players
                usually crash when cornering, and so additional
                checkpoints were placed right before each turn. -->
                <!-- keeping track of the last checkpoint cleared, and the next
                Checkpoints have been placed throughout the track for multiple reasons. First, they help track lap
                progress, and prevent cheating in doing so. Since all checkpoints must be cleared for a lap to be
                considered completed, corner-cutting is discouraged. Second, they also help with resetting the
                player after they crash their vehicle. As players usually crash when cornering, checkpoints are
                placed right before each turn. -->
                <!-- When the player crashes their vehicle, they get reset on the track after a one-second delay, at the last
                checkpoint location cleared. As crashes usually occur while players are cornering, checkpoints were
                placed right before each turn. Players gets
                The handling model is set up to treat head-on collisions with barriers as crashes, after which
                the player gets reset on the track following a one-second delay. In order to prevent player
                frustration, a checkpoint system was added to identify the best location on the track to reset player
                vehicles. Currently, the player is reset a small distance from the corner where the impact occurred.
                This was done to give them enough time to react and clear the corner as soon as they step on the
                accelerator. -->

                The checkpoint system also serves as a way to mitigate cheating behaviours. Because all checkpoints in
                a track must be cleared in order before the player is considered to have completed a lap, this means
                that attempts to cut corners and find "shortcuts" around tracks are discouraged. Through playtesting
                and understanding where cheating is more likely to occur, it will become clearer as to which areas
                should feature more checkpoints or, in more extreme cases, have their geometry reworked.
            </p> -->
            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <h3>AI Cars</h3>
            <p>
                Giving players something to race against besides the clock will add a new dimension to gameplay.
                Placing "feelers" on the front and sides of AI vehicles will give agents spatial awareness, and allow
                them to anticipate upcoming corners.
                <!-- At the very least, AI agents must be able to anticipate the direction of, and distance toward, upcoming
                corners. "Feelers" from the front and sides of vehicles
            </p>
            <p>
                At the very least, AI agents must be able to anticipate the direction of, and distance toward, upcoming
                corners. A quick solution would be to integrate this information into the checkpoint system itself, with
                the timing at which agents steer into corners being varied at random to produce more natural behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
                A more robust approach would be to leverage raycasting, using "feelers" from the front and sides of
                vehicles to give agents spatial awareness. This can produce more complex behaviours expected of a
                driver, such as determining optimal racing lines or identifying when to perform overtaking manoeuvres. -->
                <!-- </p> -->
                <!-- expected of a driver. -->

                <!-- To remedy this, a heuristic could be added to each agent that impacts
                their individual ability to estimate when to turn into a corner. This might result in more organic
                behaviour, such as making mistakes and crashing or taking suboptimal lines through turns. Nevertheless,
                this approach ignores more complex behaviours expected of a driver, such as identifying when to overtake
                a vehicle directly ahead, and taking an optimal driving line. -->
                <!-- <p>
                It would be cool to have AI vehicles that the player can race against in a single player race mode. At
                the very least, AI agents must be able to "see" ahead, anticipate approaching corners, and establish
                the direction in which they must steer. Because of the way the handling model is set up to only allow 90
                degree turns and sideways strafing, however, regular pathfinding behaviours coupled with steering forces
                added to the AI vehicle will not comply with the movement rules the player conforms to.
            </p>
            <p>
                A quick solution would be to add track and corner information into the checkpoint system itself. As AI
                vehicles pass through these checkpoints, they will obtain data that they can then use to navigate the
                track, such as the distance to the next corner and the direction they will need to steer in (a binary
                left/right value). Their movement vectors can then be modified directly. The risk
                with this approach is that agents' behaviours may not seem "natural" enough. If all agents receive the
                same track data and have nothing else to differentiate between them, then they will likely all drive the
                exact same way around the course. To remedy this, a heuristic could be added to each agent that impacts
                their individual ability to estimate when to turn into a corner. This might result in more organic
                behaviour, such as making mistakes and crashing or taking suboptimal lines through turns. Nevertheless,
                this approach ignores more complex behaviours expected of a driver, such as identifying when to overtake
                a vehicle directly ahead, and taking an optimal driving line.
            </p> -->
            <h3>More Game Modes</h3>
            <p>
                Additional game modes beyond the currently available time attack mode will provide more ways to play.
                One such example is a "survival" mode, where vehicles speed up after each complete lap, and players must
                last as long as possible without crashing.
            </p>
            <h3>An Updated Handling Model</h3>
            <p>
                Making vehicles slow down slightly when cornering and strafing will add a layer of complexity to
                gameplay, as defending positions will then cost players time.
                <!-- I'd like to adjust physics such that vehicles slow down when cornering and strafing. This will add a
                layer of complexity to gameplay, as defending positions will then cost players time. The amount by which
                speed is impacted could then be referenced via the use of a "handling" stat. As with the addition of any
                other stat, this will require fine-tuning, balancing, and playtesting. -->
                <!-- layer of complexity to overtaking manoeuvres, as players will need to be careful about how much they
                can afford to strafe to defend their position

                look at the ig page

                it is currently easy for players to defend their position,
                as strafing and cornering do not reduce vehicle speed.
                This will add a
                layer of complexity to overtaking and defending positions, to make overtaking

                stat. As with the addition of any other stat, this will require fine-tuning, balancing, and playtesting. -->

                It might also be interesting to play around with different handling models to see what adds more
                dimension to the game. Modifying behaviour such that vehicles slow down slightly when steering
                will allow for the inclusion of a "handling" stat to vehicles in the future that references this amount
                of speed lost while cornering. A better handling stat could mean less speed lost, and vice versa. As
                with the addition of any other stat, though, this will require fine-tuning, balancing, and playtesting
                to prevent certain vehicles from being disproportionately powerful compared to others.

            <!-- Something about making it so players can't always hug the inside of turns and dominate the track
            Balancing boost systems, adding ability to slipstream, so at least cars from behind can have a chance
            of overtaking the one in front. Also, worse handling means more "drift" sideways when taking corners,
            and, as a result, more speed reduction.
