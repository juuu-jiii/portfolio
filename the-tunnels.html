            <h2>Concept and Design Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Set in RIT's underground dormitory tunnel system, <i>The Tunnels</i> is a first-person psychological
                horror walking simulator that has players taking the role of a student being followed by an entity
                while trying to find their way back to their dorm room after a long day of classes.

                <!-- The walk seems longer than usual, however, and it's
                eerily quiet. Did you go down the right path?
                Why are the lights flickering? Are you being followed? <br><br>
                I worked on level, sound, and environment design to ensure
                triggers and audio/visual cues were placed strategically to contribute
                to the creation of an unsettling atmosphere riddled with dread. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                Between levels where the player is running from their pursuer (chase rooms), they are also tasked with
                mini puzzle rooms where a key must be found in order to unlock a door that leads them to the next
                level. There are a total of six levels in <i>The Tunnels</i>: four puzzle rooms and two chase rooms.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided early on that the "entity" chasing the player would be a balloon version of our school
                mascot, called Balloon Ritchie. We also wanted to avoid overt use of grotesque or violent themes, as we
                didn't think those were essential elements to drive the game's narrative. The keywords we used to
                describe the target player experience were "paranoid", "eerie", and "unsettling". Level design in the
                game supports these main themes and the player's emotions over time.

            <!-- From the outset, the team collectively agreed that the horror featured in-game would be purely
                psychological. The team decided on this because we wanted to challenge ourselves to deliver an
                experience laced with fear without any overt use of grotesque, gory, or violent themes. It was also
                based on the fact that the "entity" chasing the player is, in fact, nothing more than a balloon
                version of our school mascot, lovingly referred to as Balloon Ritchie among the student body. -->

            <!-- TODO: simplify further -->
            <h2>Pacing and Audio/Visual Cues</h2>
            <p>
                The player completes two puzzle rooms before encountering a chase room. This was done to strike
                a balance between periods of rest and engagement. During said moments of rest, though, I continued to
                build tension in the form of audio and visual cues before the player's final encounter with Balloon
                Ritchie in the second chase room.
                <!-- I arranged chase and puzzle rooms in a certain sequence to facilitate pacing, in an attempt to
                strike a balance between periods of engagement (chase rooms) and rest (puzzle rooms) for the
                player. However, I also used Freytag's Pyramid to guide my design and ensure that, even during said
                moments of "rest" during the puzzle rooms, I continued to build tension in the form of audio and visual
                cues before the player's final encounter with Balloon Ritchie. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                I used lighting as a primary source of tension. The number of flickering and fused ceiling lights
                increases as the player traverses the rooms to create the impression that things are taking a turn for
                the worse. However, in the fourth puzzle room, all ceiling lights work fine, and background music used
                in the first three puzzle rooms is absent. This contrast serves as the "calm before the storm", hinting
                at the fact that something awaits the player in the next room. This next room is where the player must
                encounter Balloon Ritchie one last time before they can escape and beat the game.

                <!-- Contrast was also used in the fourth puzzle room (fifth overall, right before the player's
                final encounter with Balloon Ritchie) to bring tension build-up to a head.

                I used lighting as the primary source of in-game tension. With each of the first three puzzle rooms
                explored, the number of flickering ceiling lights increases to give the player an elevated sense of
                concern that things are increasingly taking a turn for the worse. I also used darkness
                within the third puzzle room, in which there are areas where ceiling lights are fused. -->
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                I used contrast in the fourth puzzle room to bring tension build-up to a head. Here, all ceiling lights
                work perfectly fine, with none flickering. Furthermore, background music that was used in the first
                three puzzle rooms is absent to add to the feeling of eeriness. The goal here was to create a "calm
                before the storm" situation, and indicate to the player that something awaits them in the next room.
                This next room is where the player must encounter Balloon Ritchie one last time before they can escape
                and beat the game.
            </p> -->
            <p>
                In chase rooms, lighting and background music are significantly different to communicate impending
                danger to the player. Ceiling lights turn red to create an ominous atmosphere. Background music
                features a higher BPM, dissonant chords, and a high-pitched raid siren intro to fuel a perception of
                urgency.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                In chase rooms, graffiti is used on walls to signal the player about the upcoming encounter with Balloon
                Ritchie. Ceiling lights turn red to produce an enhanced sense of danger. In conjunction with this, a  
                (red lights, raid siren, chase music. scope, so we had to outsource this music)
            </p> -->
            <h2>Environmental Narrative</h2>
            <p>
                Narrative is delivered to the player in the form of "hidden" vignettes; by exploring levels, the
                player can discover small posters whose content, if put together, provides the game's backstory.
                We decided to use this approach because it was the most scope-friendly option, given our time
                constraints.
                <!-- Based on time constraints, this implementation made the most sense to us scope-wise. -->
                <!-- became a stretch goal that couldn't be
                accomplished on time. -->

                <!-- TODO: process, how it was a small team, and how you had to take on multiple roles -->

                <!-- Part of early team discussions revolved around the game's narrative design, and how that would be
                delivered to the player. One stretch goal included using alternate textures on the walls and pipes
                featuring claw marks to warn the player of impending danger. Another involved the placement of limp bits
                of rubber throughout later puzzle levels to imply that their stalker is, in fact, made of balloons.
                Because of scope concerns and time constraints, however, I included the storyline as "hidden" vignettes
                in-game. More specifically, by exploring the levels, the player will discover small posters whose
                content, if put together, serves to give them context and clue them in on the backstory. -->
            </p>
            <!-- <h2>Audiovisual Cues</h2>
            <p>
                Using a bunch of triggers
            </p> -->
            <!-- <h2>Snappy Controls</h2>
            <p>
                At the heart of <i>TapRacing</i> is its snappy and responsive control system. If tracks are to be
                constructed such that their geometry features sets of consecutive corners and tight turns, then players
                need to be equipped with the means to navigate such perils. It was thus important that vehicles in the
                game be able to turn at the push of a button, because of the intended fast-paced, reflex-reliant player
                experience. To this end, I had to make sure that the physics were tweaked such that the handling model
                performed as expected.
            </p>
            <h2>Checkpoint System</h2>
            <p>
                The handling model is set up to treat head-on collisions with barriers as crashes, after which
                the player gets reset on the track following a one-second delay. In order to prevent player
                frustration, a checkpoint system was added to identify the best location on the track to reset player
                vehicles. Currently, the player is reset a small distance from the corner where the impact occurred.
                This was done to give them enough time to react and clear the corner as soon as they step on the
                accelerator.
            </p>
            <p>
                The checkpoint system also serves as a way to mitigate cheating behaviours. Because all checkpoints in
                a track must be cleared in order before the player is considered to have completed a lap, this means
                that attempts to cut corners and find "shortcuts" around tracks are discouraged. Through playtesting
                and understanding where cheating is more likely to occur, it will become clearer as to which areas
                should feature more checkpoints or, in more extreme cases, have their geometry reworked.
            </p> -->
            <h2>What I Would Improve</h2>
            <!-- <h3>AI Cars</h3> -->
            <h3>Level Design Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                Keys in puzzle rooms can be difficult to find, so lighting could be leveraged to guide the player around
                subtly. On top of that, a UI hint system could be implemented to prevent players from getting stuck.
                <!-- I'd also like to use more indexical storytelling elements. This includes using decals featuring claw
                marks on walls, and limp bits of rubber on the ground, to further clue the player in on the backstory. -->
                Finally, rooms can be made more claustrophobic by lowering the ceiling and narrowing pathways, in order
                to create a more pronounced sensation of anxiety in players.
            </p>
            <h3>AI</h3>
            <p>
                AI movement behaviours could also be more refined. Because the agent always travels at a constant speed
                toward the player, it can be too fast or too slow at times. Varying this so it speeds up when far away
                from the player and slows down when nearby may help produce a more balanced and engaging experience
                overall.

                    Playtests revealed that finding keys in puzzle levels can be frustratingly difficult. More keys were
                    added to the larger puzzle rooms to remedy this, with little to no avail. Leveraging lighting
                    instead to subtly guide the player towards keys is a possible fix. A UI hint system could be used in
                    conjunction with this, to explicitly show the player where keys are placed and
                    prevent them from getting stuck in a level.

                    The introduction of the player to their pursuer in the first chase room is a little abrupt, as it
                    sometimes caught playtesters off-guard. As a result, pacing could use some improvement in
                    this section of the game. Alternatively, the graffiti on the walls in this level could be made more
                    prominent to better signal the player about the upcoming encounter with Balloon Ritchie.

                    Something about the UI and how it can be improved. It's difficult to see the keys and the doors and
                    figure out which is the right door and which isn't. Players also struggled to figure out what they
                    needed to do at the beginning despite the instructional text at the top left, meaning onboarding can
                    also use some improvement

                    Level layout could be improved by adding an increased variety of textures and environmental objects

                    claustrophic and create a more pronounced sensation of anxiety in players, pathways could be made
                    narrower or the ceiling could be lowered.

                    AI movement behaviours could be more refined. Because the agent always travels at a constant speed
                    toward the player, it can be too fast or too slow at times. Varying this so it speeds up when far
                    away from the player and slower when nearby may help produce a more balanced (and therefore
                    engaging) experience overall.

            <!-- napkin sketches - would probably have made the level layouts much more interesting, since what we did
                was OH let's just create a map however we feel like it. -->

            <!-- probably refine the AI as well because it CAN clip through walls and get stuck. Also refine the final
                scene where the entity is revealed because the damn agent won't stay still. -->

            <!-- what you would change? make the process modular to speed up the process of generating new rooms -->

            <!-- better use of vignettes, right now it's just a bunch of posters that the player can find if they explore
                the level enough. The contents are the same, though -->

            <!-- Maybe improve pacing a little because the first chase room the player encounters can be a but abrupt, if
                they fail to pay attention to the writing on the wall that says "RUN" -->

            <!-- adding some juice to the game. having the pickups fly toward the player, accompanied by a swooshing
                sound, would make for a more satisfying experience. Bonus points if the pickup flew in an arc... -->

            <!-- It would be cool to have AI vehicles that the player can race against in a single player race mode. At
                the very least, AI agents must be able to "see" ahead, anticipate approaching corners, and establish
                the direction in which they must steer. Because of the way the handling model is set up to only allow 90
                degree turns and sideways strafing, however, regular pathfinding behaviours coupled with steering forces
                added to the AI vehicle will not comply with the movement rules the player conforms to. -->
            <!-- </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
                A quick solution would be to add track and corner information into the checkpoint system itself. As AI
                vehicles pass through these checkpoints, they will obtain data that they can then use to navigate the
                track, such as the distance to the next corner and the direction they will need to steer in (a binary
                left/right value). Their movement vectors can then be modified directly. The risk
                with this approach is that agents' behaviours may not seem "natural" enough. If all agents receive the
                same track data and have nothing else to differentiate between them, then they will likely all drive the
                exact same way around the course. To remedy this, a heuristic could be added to each agent that impacts
                their individual ability to estimate when to turn into a corner. This might result in more organic
                behaviour, such as making mistakes and crashing or taking suboptimal lines through turns. Nevertheless,
                this approach ignores more complex behaviours expected of a driver, such as identifying when to overtake
                a vehicle directly ahead, and taking an optimal driving line.
            </p>
            <h3>An Updated Handling Model</h3>
            <p>
                It might also be interesting to play around with different handling models to see what adds more
                dimension to the game. Modifying behaviour such that vehicles slow down slightly when steering
                will allow for the inclusion of a "handling" stat to vehicles in the future that references this amount
                of speed lost while cornering. A better handling stat could mean less speed lost, and vice versa. As
                with the addition of any other stat, though, this will require fine-tuning, balancing, and playtesting
                to prevent certain vehicles from being disproportionately powerful compared to others.
            </p> -->

            <!-- Something about making it so players can't always hug the inside of turns and dominate the track
            Balancing boost systems, adding ability to slipstream, so at least cars from behind can have a chance
            of overtaking the one in front. Also, worse handling means more "drift" sideways when taking corners,
            and, as a result, more speed reduction.

            Different game modes, adding AI, animating crashes instead of having only text show up. -->
