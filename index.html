                Nice having you here!
                I'm Choi, a game designer and programmer who enjoys creating satisfying player experiences as
                much as tackling technical complexities.
                <!-- who's equally as passionate about programming. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- I enjoy crafting solutions to design problems as much as I do tackling technical complexities. -->
                <!-- When I'm not crafting or tweaking systems and levels to facilitate player satisfaction, I can be found -->
                When I'm not prototyping game ideas or crafting and tweaking systems and levels, I can be found
                wondering what instructions I need to feed my computer next to make it behave as intended. I love
                working on diverse teams that value growth and inclusion. There's always something to learn from each
                experience that can be applied to future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience with C# and C/C++, and some knowledge of
                JavaScript and Python. I am also familiar with both Unity and Unreal Engine.
