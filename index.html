                Nice having you here!
                I'm Choi, a game designer and programmer who enjoys creating satisfying player experiences as
                much as tackling technical complexities.
                <!-- who's equally as passionate about programming. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- I enjoy crafting solutions to design problems as much as I do tackling technical complexities. -->
                <!-- When I'm not crafting or tweaking systems and levels to facilitate player satisfaction, I can be found -->
                When I'm not prototyping game ideas or crafting and tweaking systems and levels, I can be found
                wondering what instructions I need to feed my computer next to make it behave as intended. I love
                working on diverse teams that value growth and inclusion. There's always something to learn from each
                experience that can be applied to future projects, be it new tools, design techniques, or development
                process improvements.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have experience with C# and C/C++, and some knowledge of
                JavaScript and Python. I am also familiar with both Unity and Unreal Engine.
