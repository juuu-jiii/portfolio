            <h2>Concept and Design Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Set in RIT's underground dormitory tunnel system, <i>The Tunnels</i> is a first-person psychological
                horror walking simulator that has players taking the role of a student being chased by an entity
                while trying to find their way back to their dorm room after a long day of classes.

                <!-- The walk seems longer than usual, however, and it's
                eerily quiet. Did you go down the right path?
                Why are the lights flickering? Are you being followed? <br><br>
                I worked on level, sound, and environment design to ensure
                triggers and audio/visual cues were placed strategically to contribute
                to the creation of an unsettling atmosphere riddled with dread. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                Between "chase rooms" where the player is running from their pursuer, they are also tasked with
                "puzzle rooms" where they must find a key to unlock a door that leads them to the next level.
                <!-- There are a total of six levels in <i>The Tunnels</i>: four puzzle rooms and two chase rooms. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- We decided early on that  -->
                The "entity" chasing the player is a balloon version of our school mascot, called Balloon Ritchie. We
                wanted to avoid use of grotesque or violent themes, as we didn't find those elements essential to
                driving the game's narrative. The keywords we used to describe the target player experience were
                "paranoid", "eerie", and "unsettling".
                <!-- Level design in the game supports these main themes and the player's emotions over time. -->

                over time. -->
            <!-- From the outset, the team collectively agreed that the horror featured in-game would be purely
                psychological. The team decided on this because we wanted to challenge ourselves to deliver an
                experience laced with fear without any overt use of grotesque, gory, or violent themes. It was also
                based on the fact that the "entity" chasing the player is, in fact, nothing more than a balloon
                version of our school mascot, lovingly referred to as Balloon Ritchie among the student body. -->

                The player completes two puzzle rooms before encountering a chase room to balance periods of rest and
                engagement. Throughout the experience, I kept the player immersed by building tension using audio and
                visual cues.

                moments of "rest" during the puzzle rooms, I continued to build tension in the form of audio and visual
                cues before the player's final encounter with Balloon Ritchie. -->

                I used lighting as a primary visual cue to build tension, in the form of flickering and fused ceiling
                lights within puzzle rooms. I also used combinations of music and ambient background noise to build
                tension from the audio front.
                <!-- I used lighting as a primary source of tension. The number of flickering and fused ceiling lights

                        of rubber throughout later puzzle levels to imply that their stalker is, in fact, made of balloons.
                        Because of scope concerns and time constraints, however, I included the storyline as "hidden" vignettes
                        in-game. More specifically, by exploring the levels, the player will discover small posters whose
                        content, if put together, serves to give them context and clue them in on the backstory. -->

            <h3>Level Design</h3>
            <p>
                The player could be guided around rooms better to ease finding exits and keys. Lighting could be
                leveraged to accomplish this subtly. Additionally, pipes could be placed on walls more deliberately
                to act as leading lines.
                <!-- A UI hint system could also be implemented to prevent
                players from getting stuck. -->
            </p>
            <p>
                <!-- Keys in puzzle rooms can be difficult to find, so lighting could be leveraged to guide the player
                subtly.
                Additionally, the placement of pipes on walls could be made more deliberate to act as leading lines
                where
                appropriate. -->
                <!-- I'd also like to use more indexical storytelling elements. This includes using decals featuring claw
                marks on walls, and limp bits of rubber on the ground, to further clue the player in on the backstory. -->
                Rooms can be made more claustrophobic by lowering the ceiling, narrowing pathways, and introducing more
                environmental obstacles to create a more pronounced sensation of anxiety in players.

            <h3>AI</h3>
            <p>
                Refining AI movement behaviours to give the player some time to build distance from the agent
                at the start of a chase room before being more aggressively hunted as time progresses might produce a
                more balanced and engaging experience.
                <!-- AI movement behaviours could be more refined. Because the agent always travels at a constant speed
                toward the player, it can be too fast or too slow at times. "Rubberbanding" it so it speeds up when and
                slows
                down when far away from and near to the player, respectively, might produce a more balanced and engaging
                experience. -->

                    Playtests revealed that finding keys in puzzle levels can be frustratingly difficult. More keys were
                    added to the larger puzzle rooms to remedy this, with little to no avail. Leveraging lighting
                    instead to subtly guide the player towards keys is a possible fix. A UI hint system could be used in
                    conjunction with this, to explicitly show the player where keys are placed and
                    prevent them from getting stuck in a level.

                    The introduction of the player to their pursuer in the first chase room is a little abrupt, as it
                    sometimes caught playtesters off-guard. As a result, pacing could use some improvement in
                    this section of the game. Alternatively, the graffiti on the walls in this level could be made more
                    prominent to better signal the player about the upcoming encounter with Balloon Ritchie.

                    Something about the UI and how it can be improved. It's difficult to see the keys and the doors and
                    figure out which is the right door and which isn't. Players also struggled to figure out what they
                    needed to do at the beginning despite the instructional text at the top left, meaning onboarding can

                    Level layout could be improved by adding an increased variety of textures and environmental objects
                    (such as posters and litter) to make the tunnels look more "lived in". To make the levels more
                    claustrophic and create a more pronounced sensation of anxiety in players, pathways could be made
                    narrower or the ceiling could be lowered.

                    AI movement behaviours could be more refined. Because the agent always travels at a constant speed

                    away from the player and slower when nearby may help produce a more balanced (and therefore
                    engaging) experience overall.

            <!-- probably refine the AI as well because it CAN clip through walls and get stuck. Also refine the final
                scene where the entity is revealed because the damn agent won't stay still. -->

            <!-- what you would change? make the process modular to speed up the process of generating new rooms -->

            <!-- better use of vignettes, right now it's just a bunch of posters that the player can find if they explore
                the level enough. The contents are the same, though -->

            <!-- Maybe improve pacing a little because the first chase room the player encounters can be a but abrupt, if
                they fail to pay attention to the writing on the wall that says "RUN" -->

            <!-- adding some juice to the game. having the pickups fly toward the player, accompanied by a swooshing
                sound, would make for a more satisfying experience. Bonus points if the pickup flew in an arc... -->

            <!-- It would be cool to have AI vehicles that the player can race against in a single player race mode. At
                the very least, AI agents must be able to "see" ahead, anticipate approaching corners, and establish
                the direction in which they must steer. Because of the way the handling model is set up to only allow 90
                degree turns and sideways strafing, however, regular pathfinding behaviours coupled with steering forces
                added to the AI vehicle will not comply with the movement rules the player conforms to. -->
            <!-- </p> -->
            <!-- <p>
                A quick solution would be to add track and corner information into the checkpoint system itself. As AI
                vehicles pass through these checkpoints, they will obtain data that they can then use to navigate the
                track, such as the distance to the next corner and the direction they will need to steer in (a binary
                left/right value). Their movement vectors can then be modified directly. The risk
                with this approach is that agents' behaviours may not seem "natural" enough. If all agents receive the
                same track data and have nothing else to differentiate between them, then they will likely all drive the
                exact same way around the course. To remedy this, a heuristic could be added to each agent that impacts
                their individual ability to estimate when to turn into a corner. This might result in more organic
                behaviour, such as making mistakes and crashing or taking suboptimal lines through turns. Nevertheless,
                this approach ignores more complex behaviours expected of a driver, such as identifying when to overtake
                a vehicle directly ahead, and taking an optimal driving line.
            </p>
            <h3>An Updated Handling Model</h3>
            <p>
                It might also be interesting to play around with different handling models to see what adds more
                dimension to the game. Modifying behaviour such that vehicles slow down slightly when steering
                will allow for the inclusion of a "handling" stat to vehicles in the future that references this amount
                of speed lost while cornering. A better handling stat could mean less speed lost, and vice versa. As
                with the addition of any other stat, though, this will require fine-tuning, balancing, and playtesting
                to prevent certain vehicles from being disproportionately powerful compared to others.
            </p> -->

            <!-- Something about making it so players can't always hug the inside of turns and dominate the track
            Balancing boost systems, adding ability to slipstream, so at least cars from behind can have a chance
            of overtaking the one in front. Also, worse handling means more "drift" sideways when taking corners,
            and, as a result, more speed reduction.

            Different game modes, adding AI, animating crashes instead of having only text show up. -->
